# CricPI
The (probably) MOST Minimalistic Live cricket Ever.

This repo contains my way to scrape a website (rather a webpage) to extract meaningful information about a cricket (We the Indians !) match and model it into an actual two player game and then display it on a minimalistic Nokia Graphics LCD using the Raspberry Pi.

The name of the website is blank due to supposedly legal reasons or iterative applications or requests that can cause some action but in general the idea remains the same.
